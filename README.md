# TEMPerX232

I found this USB temperature and humidity sensor on AliExpress:
https://www.amazon.com/Temperature-Humidity-Secondary-Development-TEMPerX232/dp/B076MZVDVK

It is interesting, because it has both a COM mode and a HID mode.

COM mode I assume just stands of USB serial.

HID mode should be a mode where the sensor acts as a keyboard and types the data
out into the computer it is connected to.
It might be easier to integrate with than a USB serial based sensor, because no
extra drivers are needed.

It should arrive sometime between 10/03 and 10/25.

- [ ] 10/25 Wait for the package to arrive and test it out when it comes
